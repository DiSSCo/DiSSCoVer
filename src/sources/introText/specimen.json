    "specimen": [
        "This is the specimen page. This detailed page contains all the information about a digital specimen which is harmonised within the DiSSCo data model. Because of the bulk of information, it is broken up into different segments focusing on different topics.",
        "At the top we already see quite some returning elements. The name of the specimen is displayed in big font, whilst the current level of MIDS (minimum information about a digital specimen) is displayed below it.",
        "This dropdown element can be used to select a particular version of a specimen. By default, this will always be the latest version.",
        "On the top right is the actions dropdown. This dropdown lists items with certain actions that can be executed upon the specimen. Follow the action specific tutorials for more on that.",
        "On the left we see a familiar component: the ID card. Similar to the ID card on the search page, this component displays all core properties of the specimen, like for example: the physical identifier, type and specimen provider (organisation). The ID card is a static element which will always remain in place on this page.",
        "Then, the biggest space on this page is appointed to the display of detailed specimen data. The different heritages of these data are divided by tabs, like: digital specimen, original data, digital media and provenance. By default, the digital specimen tab will be displayed.",
        "In the digital media tab you can browse through the specimen data. This is also further divided into segmented blocks with assigned categories of data. For example: the location block only displays data about the location of the specimen, while the taxonomy block contains all taxonomic details.",
        "The original data tab displays an overview table containing the data as they were originally received from the source. Because DiSSCo harmonises the source data, it is moulded into a slightly different data model. That is why this displays the exact source material to indicate the original format.",
        "If present, the digital media tab displays all the digital media attached to a specimen. Currently, the interface supports: images, videos and audio to be seen and heard. All other kinds of media will be displayed as attached files and tagged as ‘other media’.",
        "The provenance tab lists all humans or machines who contributed to the foundation and enrichment of the specimen. For the foundation, the original authors are credited. For the enrichment, all humans or machines who made accepted annotations are credited."
    ],
    "annotate": [
        "DiSSCover’s main purpose is to give users the power to enrich existing specimen data. These enrichments are called: ‘annotations’. An annotation can be an addition or a correction; but other types like links, quality flags or a regular comment are also supported. Annotations exist to keep discussion about data quality alive. At the moment, annotations are read only and do not have any effect on the actual specimen data itself. This will be implemented in the future when a solid trust model has been established.",
        "First off, where do these annotations hide? Well they are kept in a separate side panel which is disabled on default. There are multiple ways to trigger the annotation side panel. The most generic method is to select ‘view all annotations’ from the actions dropdown.",
        "Select ‘view all annotation’ from the actions dropdown.",
        "This is the annotations side panel. As you can see, annotations might pop up already depending on whether the specimen you are looking at has annotations or not. This side panel contains all functionality related to annotations and can show up in more places than just the specimen page.",
        "You can filter on motivation type and also order displayed annotations, for example by creation date. Motivation types describe the purpose of annotations. Current motivations include: commenting, linking, adding, correcting and quality flagging.",
        "To hide the side panel, click on this arrow pointing to the left at the top left corner.",
        "As mentioned, there are multiple methods for triggering the annotations side panel. Another method for triggering the side panel, for a specific property of a specimen, is by selecting that property from the view. This is a useful method for when you only want to see annotations made for that property, or if you want to create an annotation on that property.",
        "Let’s trigger the annotations side panel for the scientific name only. We can achieve this by clicking on the scientific name property in the ID card.",
        "As you can see this triggered the annotations side panel. In this case, specifically for the scientific name property. This is indicated at the top of the side panel, noting the chosen property and its current value.",
        "You can easily switch between specimen properties by clicking on another property in the view next to the side panel. For example, this simulates switching between the scientific name, specimen provider and licence properties. Everytime, the specific annotations are loaded for the chosen property only.",
        "You can return to the overview of all annotations by clicking on the arrow to the left on the top that would normally close the side panel. If a specific property is chosen, it will first return to the overview of all annotations, before closing the entire side panel.",
        "To add new annotations, you need to be logged into your DiSSCo account. A button will appear at the bottom of the side panel saying ‘add annotation’. Click on this button to display the annotation form.",
        "Using this form, you can add annotations.",
        "First you can choose a specimen property or add an annotation on the whole specimen. The difference is that a property specific annotation will show up in the side panel when an user selects the property from the view, while annotations on the whole specimen only show up in the total overview.",
        "Next, select one of the available motivation types. Selecting one will trigger the remaining fields of the form. These fields are directly influenced by the motivation type as not all are required with every type.",
        "After filling in these fields with your values, save the annotation by clicking on the ‘save’ button. This will save your annotation and redirect you back to the overview, highlighting the new annotation.",
        "To edit one of your existing annotations, click on the pencil icon.",
        "To delete one of your existing annotations, click on the trash can icon."
